**URL-CHECKER APP**
This is a small project created in duration of 1 day. The project was given by quickblicks.io in order to check my coding competency in 2nd round of interview.

For Backend code you can check the rep:  https://github.com/HuzaifaBanegar/url-checker-app-backend.git

The project is created using Following Tech Stacks: 
1. Client side ->Recat
2. Styling-> Tailwind, Material UI
3. Backend -> NodeJs, Express
4. Deployment -> **Netlify** for Frontend and **Render** for Backend

The project consists of following feature:
1.** URL Input Field**: The form should have an input field where the user can enter a URL. The field should include validation to ensure that the URL is in the correct format and that it is a valid URL. (We should have submit button as well)
  
2. **Three Options**: The form should have three options for the user to select from:
A) **Check for a 200 Status:** This option should check whether the URL returns a 200 status code or not. If the URL returns a 200 status code, the user should receive a success message. If it does not return a 200 status code, the user should receive an error message.
B) **SSL Certificate Verification:** This option should check whether the SSL certificate of the URL is valid or not. If the certificate is valid, the user should receive a success message. If it is not valid, the user should receive an error message.
C)**Content of Robert.txt:** This option should check whether the content of robert.txt file exists or not on the server. If the file exists, the user should receive a success message. If it does not exist, the user should receive an error message.

3. **Mobile-Friendly UI:** The form should have a mobile-friendly UI with a responsive layout that adjusts to different screen sizes. The UI should be intuitive and easy to use.
   
4. **Rate Limiter:** The API should include a rate limiter that limits the user to three API calls per five minutes to prevent excessive use.

Simple Method of use:
1. NOTE: PLEASE INSTALL **ALLOW CORS** extension in your Chrome browser(preferable)
2. Go to the netlify link: https://url-checker-app.netlify.app
4. Try out the app. Please let me know if it can be improved in any ways :)
